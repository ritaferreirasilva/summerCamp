title: Can I work remotely?
---
Sure! Our participants have the option of working from home, from our offices in Braga, or from another location at their disposal. We are proud to have candidates from around the world and we just try to guarantee some overlap when it comes to working hours, so that there can be moments of synchronous coordination between the team and mentors.
