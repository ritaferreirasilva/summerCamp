title: How many teams participate in the Summer Camp?
---
Just one. We look for 1 Product Manager, 1 Product Designer, and 2 to 3 Developers per cohort. Our focus is on ensuring that this group's experience is the best possible, so we allocate all the necessary resources to our campers' learning and keep it to one group only.
