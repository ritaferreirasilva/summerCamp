title: What will my day-to-day be like?
---
During the first week the focus will be on getting to know each other to create strong working relationships. As the project progresses, each participant is expected to develop their part of the work with the full support of the mentors, and in constant coordination with the rest of the team.

The participantsâ€™ day-to-day usually involves meetings with the team and with their mentors, constant learning, and networking with other members of Subvisual as well as the Subvisual Universe, etc. Ultimately, everyone will have the autonomy to decide how to allocate their time!
